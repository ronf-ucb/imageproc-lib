 * Revisions:
 *  Andrew Pullin       2014       Initial publish to imageproc-lib
 *
 * Usage:
 * There are three requed macros to be defined, in settings.h:
 *       #define TELEM_TYPE myTelemStruct_t
 *       #define TELEM_INCLUDE "my_telem.h"
 *       #define TELEMPACKFUNC(x) myTelemGetData(x)
 *
 * The header file referenced by TELEM_INCLUDE must be defined.
 * See https://github.com/biomimetics/roach/blob/master/lib/vr_telem.h for an
 * example of how to set up this file.
 * Similarly, the matching C file that implements TELEMPACKFUNC(x) must exist.
 * See https://github.com/biomimetics/roach/blob/master/lib/vr_telem.c for an
 * example implementation matching he header above.
